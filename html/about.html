            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am from Sugar Land, Texas, and graduated from George Ranch High School. Currently, I am a freshman at Texas A&M University, majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in Technical Sales. I am eager to gain experience in the tech field through internships or any opportunities related to computers and engineering. This will help kickstart my career as a Computer Engineer and build my skills. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with projects, playing basketball and tennis, biking, and video games.</p>
